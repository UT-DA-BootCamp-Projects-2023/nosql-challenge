*************----------To Execute/verify the Jyupter notebook ----------*************<br>

* --Open the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynp (Jupyter Source File) using Visual studio code
* --Ensure correct Kernel is selected. 
* --Ensure required dataset is under Resources folder and the Resource folder is placed in the same level as the Jupyter source file is placed to avoid error.
* --Click Run All or Run individual code in sequence it is written. Running the code block in between might throw error as the variables used in that code block might be defined in the prior code block. Hence recommended to Run All to ensure it is run in sequence.
